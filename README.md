# 🛒 Sales & Inventory Analysis – Zepto Dataset (MySQL Project)

## 📊 Project Overview

This project involves performing a comprehensive **Sales and Inventory Analysis** on a retail dataset inspired by Zepto – a fast-growing online grocery delivery platform. Using **MySQL**, I cleaned, transformed, and analyzed the data to uncover actionable insights and solve real-world business challenges.
